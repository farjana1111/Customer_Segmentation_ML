# Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to perform customer segmentation using machine learning. Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so that companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately. In this project, we use KMeans clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to perform customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior.
